## Dataset

> This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, you will conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset Ford GoBike System Data. I will use Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part should be structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships.

> This document explores a dataset containing the trip data of the ford gobike approximately 183,412 with 16 features (duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude ,end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip). Most variables are 9 numerical, and others are 2 datetime, 4 object type and 1 is boolean type.

## Summary of Findings

> we can see that higher percentage of female and other rides longer trips then males although number of male riders are very high then other and female.The distribution is more concentrated between 20 to 40 years old. Subscribers mostly used bikes on workdays (Monday - Friday), while customers bikes usage was about the same for the whole week with a slight increment on Friday and Saturday.when we viewed by month with out setting a duration limit , the plot shows that both customers and subscribers had approximatly longer trip duration

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Distribution of Trip Durations: Trip Durations in the dataset take on a very large range of values. Number of Trips values first increases starting from around 8000 values to 12500 values at peak around 600 seconds but then starts to fall below at 2000 values.

> Distribution of User Age: In the case of age, the distribution is more concentrated between 20 to 40 years old.
> Subscribers mostly used bikes on workdays (Monday - Friday), while customers bikes usage was about the same for the whole week with a slight increment on Friday and Saturday
